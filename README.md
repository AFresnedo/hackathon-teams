# Hackathon Teams

An example CRUD Express app. Handy for showing AJAX PUT and DELETE methods.

## Directions

Fork and clone this repository. Run `npm install` in the directory 
in order to install all the dependencies in package.json.

Most of an app has already been written for you - so stop and take a look at what it does! Run `nodemon` and get familiar with the existing functionality.

## Requirements

The PUT and DELETE routes are missing from this project. 

* Implement PUT and DELETE routes in the controller 
* Implement the AJAX call needed to from the front end. (Alternatively you may use the [method-override module](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override) if you wish - the easiest option is overriding with a query string value.)
* Implement the views/forms/buttons needed for PUT and DELETE such that you have a fully functional CRUD system allowing you to view, add, edit, and delete hackathon teams as needed

## Bonus

* Put some real effort into styling the site - look at some real-life sites for inspiration! What do you think it would take to have people want to use it?
* Deploy your site on Heroku.
