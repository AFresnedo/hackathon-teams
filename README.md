# Hackathon Teams

An example CRUD Express app. Handy for showing AJAX PUT and DELETE methods.

## Directions

Fork and clone this repository. Run "npm install" in the directory 
in order to install all the dependencies in package.json.

## Requirements

Most of an app has already been written for you - but the PUT and 
DELETE routes are missing. Implement those routes and the AJAX needed 
to call them.
